# ARC System: Autonomous Response & Coordination System

An AI-powered system designed to enhance emergency response by autonomously detecting, tracking, and identifying persons of interest (POIs) from drone video feeds.

## Setup and Installation

It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

To create a virtual environment, run the following command:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

To activate the virtual environment (on macOS/Linux):
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Modules

### Communication & External Data Management Module
*   Manages real-time video streams from drones.
*   Handles communication with external systems (e.g., emergency services).
*   Manages data storage and retrieval.

### ARC Engine Core

#### Human Detection Sub-Module
*   Utilizes a YOLOv8-based model to detect humans in video frames.
*   Filters out non-human objects to focus on relevant targets.

#### Target Tracking Sub-Module
*   Assigns a unique ID to each detected person.
*   Tracks individuals across consecutive frames using an object tracking algorithm.

#### Facial Recognition Sub-Module
*   Crops and enhances facial images of tracked individuals.
*   Compares facial features against a database of POIs.
*   Flags a match if a POI is identified.

#### Reinforcement Learning (RL) System for Drone Control
*   An intelligent agent that learns optimal drone control policies.
*   Maximizes the quality of facial image captures by adjusting the drone's position and camera angle.
*   Receives rewards based on the clarity and angle of captured facial images.

### Dispatcher Dashboard (GUI) Module
*   A web-based interface for human dispatchers.
*   Displays real-time video feeds with bounding boxes and tracking IDs.
*   Alerts dispatchers when a POI is identified.
*   Allows for manual intervention and control.

### Diagnostics & Logging Module
*   Monitors the health and performance of all system components.
*   Logs critical events, errors, and system metrics for analysis and debugging.

## Operational Flows

1.  **Data Ingestion:** The system receives a live video feed from a drone.
2.  **Human Detection:** The Human Detection sub-module processes each frame to identify humans.
3.  **Target Tracking:** The Target Tracking sub-module assigns IDs and tracks detected individuals.
4.  **Facial Recognition:** The Facial Recognition sub-module attempts to identify tracked individuals as POIs.
5.  **RL-Driven Drone Control:** The RL system adjusts the drone's flight path to improve facial image quality for unidentified targets.
6.  **Dispatcher Notification:** The Dispatcher Dashboard alerts a human operator if a POI is detected, displaying all relevant information.

## Technical Stack & Development

*   **Backend:** Python (for AI/ML models and core logic), FastAPI (for web services).
*   **Frontend:** React/Vue.js (for the Dispatcher Dashboard).
*   **AI/ML:** PyTorch, YOLOv8, Deep SORT (or similar for tracking), Reinforcement Learning libraries (e.g., Stable Baselines3).
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL or a suitable alternative for storing POI data and logs.
*   **Development:** Follow standard Git workflow (feature branches, pull requests). All code must be linted, formatted, and include unit tests.
